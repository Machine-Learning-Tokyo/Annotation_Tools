# Open Source Annotation Tools for Computer Vision and NLP tasks

[makesense.ai][1] is a free to use online tool for labelling photos. Thanks to the use of a browser it does not require any complicated installation - just visit the website and you are ready to go. It also doesn't matter which operating system you're running on - we do our best to be truly cross-platform. It is perfect for small computer vision deeplearning projects, making the process of preparing a dataset much easier and faster. Prepared labels can be downloaded in one of multiple supported formats. Documentation and more details can be found in the project [repository][2].
